+	lazy connections to the database
-	free memory from result sets after queries you've pulled all the data out
-	support for sequences
-	paginated result sets
-	pre-loading of data for many objects at a time
	-	run a sql statement, possibly excluding the field info
	-	look up the field info if necessary (if we used our own query language )
	-	create objects from the results
-	redundant file systems
	-	register two other file systems and make sure it gets written to both of them each time
	-	if either fails on a write
		-	throw an error
		-	log the error
	-	randomly choose one to read from
-	function to take two database connections and copy between them
	-	schema
	-	data
	-	settings
	-	copy or exclude only specific tables, settings, other objects, data ranges, etc
	-	copy linked data based on associations set up in DbObject or config files
-	enhance DbObject
	-	relationships
		+	one-to-one
		+	one-to-many
		+	many-to-one
		+	and many-to-many
		-	distinguish between aggregate, ownership, and mapped relationships
		-	have a way to indicate that you want to pre-load the objects from these relationships
	-	figure out how to handle multiple database connections
		-	map by class
		-	map by function(classname, id) - returns connection
		-	map by object
	-	static functions
		-	functions
			-	findOne
			-	findMany
			-	findAll???
			-	createOne
			-	createMany
			-	getOne
			-	getMany
		-	handling
			-	pass the name of the class name you are dealing with
			-	have zap create stubs in each new subclass to let you call SubClassName::staticFunction(...);
				-	use __classname__ or whatever it is so it can be identical in every subclass file
				-	discontinue these if we have late static binding
			-	try in every way to keep SQL out of the controllers and views
				-	always create wrapper relationships, refiners, and wraper methods in the domain objects to keep SQL where it belongs
	-	have a facility for creating often used queries within DbObject subclasses
		-	a names set of paramaters to add to the where clause
			-	examples
			 	-	'currentManagerReview' => array('type' => self::managerType, 'period_id' => $gCurrentPeriod)
				-	'currentManagerReview => "<this>.type = " . self::managerType . " and <this>.period_id = $gCurrentPeriod";
	-	set up abstract methods called with DbObject::__construct
		-	relate: use this to set up relationships
		-	refine: use this to set up named queries
-	evaluate doctrine
	-	doctrine query language
	-	how it handles prepared statements vs paramater escaping
	-	connection management - how do we want to do it?
-	support for options fields, you give it the table, the mapped field, and a list of options
	-	add the field to the table
	-	create the options table (you could combine many into one table, then you could skip this step it the table exists)
	-	insert all the options into the table
-	various tree handling libraries
