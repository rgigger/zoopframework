-	make a ConfigException for handling problems with configuraion
	-	DbConfig exception???
-	Configurable interface
	-	methods
		-	getRequireds
		-	getDefaults
	-	any object in your module that needs to use configuration information should implement this interface
-	make it possible to have multiple config files with
	+	priority
		+	first come first served policy.  whoever defines it first decides what is used
		+	or somehow define who has priority when the config file is imported into the general config space (we used this apporach)
	-	possible scenarios
		+	each module has a config with default settings
		+	each application has a config with application defaults which may override module settings
		-	each installation has a config that may override the application or module defaults
		-	other more compelex scenarios
-	caching
	-	take the final array and store it to a file for quick loading
-	inline config???
	-	maybe use the format that has been presented for new php array syntax but put it in a string and parse it
