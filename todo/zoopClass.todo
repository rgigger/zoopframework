-	fix how it loads classes, make it use the dynamic loading stuff
	+	add in the auto include stuff
	-	use if for all of the zoop modules
	-	some concept of depencencies
		-	for instance guizone depends on gui and zone.  how should me make sure that these things are loaded?
-	public files
	+	make them work (accessible from with the application with no configuration)
	-	make it so you can concat multiple so if you have a bunch of modules with tiny css or js files you can just download one consolidated file
