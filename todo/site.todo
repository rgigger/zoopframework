-	google code site
	-	update the site to reflect the new roadmap and relationship with old zoop
		-	reference the roadmap indicated on the zoopframework site
			-	http://zoopframework.com/about/1.5/release-notes
	-	show how to set up the apps, including zap?
	-	wiki
		-	new page: mvc, design patterns, architectures, etc.
			-	we've been using the common web-MVC terminology because it has been convenient but it's time to get explicit
			-	list all the articles
			-	overview of mvc and pac
			-	general concept of separation of concerns and other patterns
			-	history of the evolution of zoop controllers, models, views, etc
				-	crazy mess of everything mixed together, the PHP that everyone hates
				-	breaking presentation (html generation) out into templates
				-	trying to implement pretty urls drove me to develop a routing system for requests
				-	having all of the logic in the zones was obviously terrible, we started to break things out into objects
				-	it became apparent that almost all of these needed to do db acess and had similar needs, hence DbObject
				-	so we have templates, zones, and DbObject, not Models, Views and Controller base classes
				-	controller is such a generic term our zones could be called a front controller (insert the Harry Feuks 
					rant of several years ago)
				-	new name for this design pattern
			-	elements of MVC
				-	the view has direct access to the model
					-	are we doing this?
						-	we have the controller passing stuff in but it is passing in domain objects directly
							not using some intermediary format
				-	obsever pattern
					-	obviously we don't generally do this on the web, zoop doesn't do this inherently, but it possible 
						with comet and similar methods
				-	the controller handles low level events and updates the model which in turn updates the views
			-	history of MVC
				-	smalltalk80
				-	sun
				-	next
				-	the guys with the books
				-	RoR
				-	django
				-	struts
				-	etc
			-	does anything adhere to strict MVC
			-	can this work synchronously over the web
			-	elements of a web app
				-	routing requests
					-	to the appropriate view
					-	to modify the model
				-	brokering between the view and the model (PAC style vs MVC style)
					-	should this really be done by the controller?
						-	one extreme: extract all data from the model in an intermediate format suitable for processing by the view
						-	the middle ground: gathering appropriate model objects and passing them into the view
						-	a little further: passing in a root app domain object and letting it get everything it wants from there
						-	the other extreme: allowing the view to obtain all view objects itself
					-	what good does the intermediate format do you
						-	what works well with the templating language
						-	how much work is done to reformat
						-	if all data must be brokered it allows you to see exactly what data the view uses
						-	if you only pass in root heirarchy objects though then you still won't be able to tell
						-	is it easier to just look at the template to tell or to look at it here
					-	where should authorization logic go
						-	in the view?
						-	in the broker?
						-	in the model?
					-	will allowing the view to access the model result in tight coupling
						-	it didn't have that affect in desktop apps, why would it here
						-	why would views need it in any way other than anything else
						-	if the accessors are good then they should be good with everything
						-	yes you could dump a bunch of view specific stuff in there but you can't prevent all bad behavior any more
							than you can keep domain logic out of the template
					-	decisions, decisions
						-	if you opt for too little brokering you will sometimes have data that is too hard to format with the template 
							language, or your templates will be have too much confusing logic that should be separated out
							-	examples???
						-	if you do too much brokering then you will do a ton of unnecessary work to reformat the data when it doesn't 
							need to be reformatted
							-	examples???
						-	the awkwardness of the templating language is definitely a concern
						-	should the reformatting of the info really be outside the view?
						-	examples
							-	putting data into a table
								-	traverse it with DbObject accessors
								-	have some utility for extracting the data in some format that a table object can understand
							-	a heirarchical structure
								-	same as table
				-	handling events, changes to the model
				-	navigation
				-	authentication and authorization
				-	authorization
				-	validation
			-	the main difference between a web app and a desktop app
				-	there are two event loops
					-	the request, response loop where events result in generating new views and altering the model
					-	the local event loop that you handle with javascript that may update the current view or make new requests
			-	TOC
				-	Separation of Concerns
				-	MVC
				-	PAC and other relevant patterns
				-	Evolution of Zoop, what Zoop allows you to do
					-	include notes on how each element in zoop relates to the different patterns
				-	Recommendation of a specific pattern

	-	differences betweenteen old zoop and new zoop page
		-	differences
			-	general naming conventions
			-	include all outside dependencies
			-	no pear
			-	only support PHP 5.1.x and above
			-	magic naming schemes
				-	different magic naming conventions for zones and pages
			-	api changes
				-	and changes to class names and method names
				-	new ways to access zone and page paramaters
				-	new apis
					-	view a colorized virtual path
		-	link both to and from a topic on the users mailing list for people to discuss 
	-	have a "magic" section for every place we use convention over configuration - try to have the best of both worlds
	-	design goals page
