wit works well for
	serializing objects
		there could be trouble handling long and / or multiline attributes
	documenting a structured set of simple procedures such as in a build system where you don't need a turing complete langugae
		this means it will not have a complete set of structures like loops and conditionls
		but if it did the syntax would actually be very interesting
